# 📈 Linear Regression with Gradient Descent

This is a Python project that builds a simple linear regression model from scratch using gradient descent. The goal is to predict a student's exam score based on the number of hours they studied.

## 📌 Features

- Reads study data from a CSV file (`HoursScores.csv`)
- Implements linear regression using gradient descent (no ML libraries)
- Plots the data and best-fit line
- Takes user input for hours studied and predicts the score

## 🛠️ Tools Used

- Python
- Pandas (for data handling)
- Matplotlib (for plotting)

## 📂 Files

- `linear_regression.py` – Main script
- `HoursScores.csv` – Dataset
- `README.md` – Project description

## 📈 Example

```text
Enter hours studied: 5
Predicted score: 51.42
